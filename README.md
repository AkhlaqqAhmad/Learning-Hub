# Learning-Hub
Utilized core Generative AI principles to implement a RAG based learning Assistant, specifically targeting Academia sector.

Where User can upload any book or if running through code can provide multiple books of any size (Depending on their computing recources) and then ask questions related to that book/document.

While implementing the main focus is to reduce as much hallucination as possible and somehow successfull doing that, When the model don't know the answer or the question is out of context then it'll simple say I don't know rather than hallucinating the responses.
